## Main topics
- Energy efficiency in building heating and cooling
- Heat exchangers, energy recovery
- Microfluidics
- Acoustic streaming 

## Micro- to mini-fluidics
Here we use *active* or *passive* process intensification techniques to enhance heat and mass transfer. For *active* techniques, we associate vibration (mechanical, acoustic or ultrasonic) sources to special flow channels (with sharp edges, bubbles...) to generate strong streaming flow. For *passive* process intensification, we have developped a patented flexible heat exchanger made of polymer. 

Below is a video showing how we enhance drop merging by mechanical vibration:
